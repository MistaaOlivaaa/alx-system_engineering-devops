## 0x00-shell_basic


## Description

This project is the first step into the world of the shell (Bash) in the ALX Software Engineering program. It covers the very basic commands and concepts needed to navigate and interact with a Linux system's command line interface.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain and use the following concepts and commands without external help:

### General Concepts
*   What is the Shell?
*   What is the difference between a terminal and a shell?
*   What is the command line interface (CLI)?
*   Navigating the filesystem (`pwd`, `cd`, `ls`)
*   Directory structure (root `/`, home `~`, parent `..`, current `.`)
*   Looking around (`ls` options like `-l`, `-a`, `-la`)
*   Manipulating files (`touch`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`)
*   Working with directories (`mkdir`, `rmdir`)
*   Understanding file paths (absolute vs. relative)
*   Getting help (`man`, `whatis`)

### Specific Commands Covered (examples)
*   `pwd`: Print working directory (the current directory).
*   `ls`: List directory contents.
*   `cd`: Change directory.
*   `touch`: Create an empty file or update timestamp.
*   `cp`: Copy files or directories.
*   `mv`: Move or rename files or directories.
*   `rm`: Remove files.
*   `mkdir`: Make directories.
*   `rmdir`: Remove empty directories.
*   `file`: Determine file type.
*   `less`: View file content page by page.
*   `head`: Output the first part of files.
*   `tail`: Output the last part of files.
*   `ln`: Make links between files (symbolic links covered later).
*   `wc`: Print newline, word, and byte counts for each file.
*   `cat`: Concatenate files and print on the standard output.
*   `echo`: Display a line of text.
*   `printf`: Format and print data.
*   `whoami`: Print effective userid.
*   `exit`: Cause the shell to exit.
*   `history`: Display command history.
*   `clear`: Clear the terminal screen.

## Requirements

### General
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
*   All scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
*   All scripts should be exactly two lines long (`wc -l file` should print 2).
*   All script files must end with a new line.
*   The first line of all script files must be exactly `#!/bin/bash`.
*   A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
*   All script files must be executable (`chmod +x filename`).
*   Your code should use the `&&` and `||` shell logical operators where appropriate.
*   You are not allowed to use `sed` or `awk`.
